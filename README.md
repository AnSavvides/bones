## Bones ##

Bones is boilerplate to get you started with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

This project is very much a work in progress - there is plenty to be done for this to become a 'proper' boilerplate.

In terms of templating one option for now is Underscore's [micro-templating](http://underscorejs.org/#template), but [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) might be a better fit for larger scale projects as it has quite a few more features (e.g. custom helper methods).
